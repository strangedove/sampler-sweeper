# Slop Patterns - Lazy/uncreative text detection patterns
#
# This file contains patterns used to detect AI-generated "slop" text:
# overused phrases, cliches, purple prose, and structural problems.
#
# Two types of patterns:
#   1. literal_strings - Case-insensitive substring matches (each occurrence counts)
#   2. regex_patterns  - Regular expressions (compiled with re.IGNORECASE)
#
# To customize: edit this file or create your own and pass its path to the sweep config.
# Duplicates are harmless (counted once per actual occurrence in text).
